# Practice-Web-Design-Page-2

An update to an earlier project I uploaded.  The idea is to create a page to use as my eventual portfolio.  There are temporary placeholders for the portfolio pieces which will be updated in a future commit.  Uses basic html and css.  I attempting to add interactivity by change the color of the contact links on mouseover using javascript.
